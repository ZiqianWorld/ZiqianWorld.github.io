At first, I submitted two photographs as required, namely A and B here for clarity, and mentioned that I preferred A. However, the faculty assistants (I assume it was them) ended up choosing B and replied that they couldn’t tell which one I preferred since they couldn’t see the filenames. I then asked them to use a new photograph, C, which I attached. It turned out that this one looks perfect to me. Bblythe took many photographs for me to consider. She said that C doesn’t look like me and that I appear too \u0026ldquo;polite\u0026rdquo; in it. I answered: \u0026ldquo;True! But don’t you see? That’s precisely what a profile photograph is supposed to look like.\u0026rdquo;\nPhotograph by Bblythe 8/30 # 我认为「阿金很忙」是B站最权威的海贼王up主。\nI really want to play RACCOIN: Coin Pusher Roguelike! However, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t support macOS, so I have to buy a PC (and a screen monitor! This will be a plan after moving to another flat at the end of the year. For now, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a desk with enough size for all of these). Anyway, I was playing 9 kings instead as a substitute, because it was just on a 50% discount. An amazing facet of the Steam platform is that you can always find unique, creative, surprising indie games. I beat all nine kings, some of them are so imba, so I just played and won, while some are weak and thus I needed to think up some strategies, but still, I have fun. The figure shows a Lab Rat Solo Strategy I used. The ability of rats is \u0026ldquo;Leveling up whenever adjacent plots level up, with no max level\u0026rdquo;, so basically you just need to deploy rats at every plot, combining with a tower that can automatically level up a random plot at the end of a round. This strategy has unlimited growth, but I only got to round 92 due to the computer\u0026rsquo;s performance.\n9 Kings 8/31 # Whenever there is a conflict in the relationship, I remind myself of these words from The Little Prince: I shouldn’t have listened to her. You must never listen to flowers. You must look at them and smell them. Mine perfumed my planet… I should have judged her according to her actions, not her words. She perfumed my planet and lit up my life… I ought to have realized the tenderness underlying her silly pretensions.\n9/2 Living in the Live # I watched Tommy Emmanuel live tonight. he mentioned the name of his upcoming album, which I misunderstood as Living in the Live. Turns out, it should be Living in the light, when I searched for it on the Internet later. However, I prefer the name I misheard.\nAn old man who are living in the light 9/3 Student Orientation # I spent two hours participating in the student orientation event today. BTW, I spent two and a half hours commuting and this happens every weekday when I need to be on campus. I usually cannot do nothing during these periods. To make some changes, I brought my laptop to this orientation event, but I eventually didn\u0026rsquo;t use it because my walkpaper is a Japanese anime girl with a slightly acceptable erotic style, sitting in a shopping cart. I had forgotten to change the walkpaper and I didn\u0026rsquo;t sit at the last row, so I would be socially dead if I opened my laptop.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t like 内卷, but I gradually realise that, except for some things that happen ordinarily, things will be different if you find the area that interests you. It\u0026rsquo;s not just for survival, or seeking money, or social status, which often makes you become someone else rather than be yourself. What I really enjoy is \u0026ldquo;building sand castles at the beach\u0026rdquo;, just like a child, to experience pure happiness and satisfaction.\n9/4 # I read the manga Ajin: Semi-Human (亞人, あじん).\nI was researching China\u0026rsquo;s sixth generation strike fighters and the history of 成飞 and 沈飞, the two industries that developed different prototypes. When I say \u0026ldquo;researching\u0026rdquo;, I mean watching videos on Bilibili.\nToday I nigotiated with my PhD supervisor and confirmed that I don\u0026rsquo;t need to be on campus on weekdays, differ to the old time when I worked as a full-time research assistant. Another thing was the preparation for the ARWA 2026 conference. I realised that I cannot use the funding to travel to the conference until I pass the qualification exam and become a PhD candidate. I may still be able to be there, with my supervisor (using his funding instead). Hope this happens.\n9/5 # I was just on the balcony, gathering my laundry /ˈlɔːn.dri/, and I saw the biggest cockroach (蟑螂) that I have ever seen in my life (as big as my big toe). It fell out of the clothes, and then I wanted to stomp on it. However, it rushed away to the edge of the balcony railing /ˈreɪ.lɪŋ/ and spread its wings and flew away.\nI think a very difference between youth and tidious adults is the frequency of sharing thoughts (like, on social media platforms). Young people feel excited about everything and would like to let others know. I don\u0026rsquo;t mean adults don\u0026rsquo;t act like that, but they have to be like an adult in most situations. Now, I really enjoy this personal website. I can record myself in such a relatively private space compared with other social media apps, and only those who are very interested in me or really care about me will spend their time visiting this website to check my weird thoughts. I feel safe.\n9/7 # Bilibili is the best web music player.\n9/9 A Dream # I have a dream this early morning: Every animal on earths becomes extreme aggressive and grows sharp teeth. I ran to a spaceship at a playground (possibly the one in my primary school). I was safe once I was onboarded. The broadcast on the spaceship announced, in English (it seems like this is the first time I dream in English), that earth is not suitable for living anymore, so we were gonna leave to search for a new planetm but no any spacesuits would be provided.\n9/11 Another Dream # I have another dream today: I was bitten by a short, fat おじさん and became a vampire. I hunt other students. To avoid being caught, I would quietly descend from the upper floor of the student apartment building to the lower floor after attacking someone. This succeeded several times, but people became suspicious of me gradually.\n9/13 # I was wondering whether the neural activities in the human brain (e.g., neural functions) that correspond to a specific psychological behaviour (e.g., decision making) are one-to-one correspondences between individuals, or just appear some kind of similar in specific brain areas? I doubt it\u0026rsquo;s the latter. For example, someone may train a Bert, while others train a GPT.\nPhonological awareness is also useful during spelling, this is what I learned from personal experience. Taking \u0026ldquo;engieering\u0026rdquo; as an example of long English words (well, at least, for English beginning learners, it\u0026rsquo;s long), every time I write \u0026ldquo;engieering\u0026rdquo;, I will first think about \u0026ldquo;engine\u0026rdquo;, and then realise that the second half should be something like \u0026ldquo;deer\u0026rdquo; puls \u0026ldquo;ing\u0026rdquo;. Which means, the spelling of long words can be decoded as the combination of some short words and/or compounds. Such a process should become automated and unconscious after practising.\nChinese people can \u0026ldquo;remedy\u0026rdquo; the lack of an element in 五行 (i.e., gold, wood, water, fire, earth) by naming themselves with a special Chinese character. For example, if you lack wood (木), your parents propably would add 森 or 林 in your name (many woods here, right?). But I was wondering, how do foreigners remedy this? They don\u0026rsquo;t have Chiense characters (logographic language) in their names! Turns out, such a process is just an unscientific Chinese traditional belief to help lazyman name their children without effort.\nI was reading a New York Times article, which introduces stuff about a pre-eminent professor. So, I just realised that the name of the rapper Eminem implies eminent!? How interesting. I really need to read more to be a pro.\n9/14 A Weekend Visit # I met Professor Chongxian Chen at South China Agricultural University this weekend with Bblythe. I like the campus.\n9/16 # I stayed up late to play Hollow Knight: Silksong last night. I waked up at 10:00, and bought two tickets for 盘尼西林\u0026rsquo;s livehouse at 11:11 (the exact beginning time of ticket purchase opening). This livehouse is scheduled on October 20, the day before my birthday.\n9/17 # I discussed possible future humanoid robot servant products with Bblythe, who has a strict requirement for daily cleaning at home. We agreed that people should also be polite to robots.\n9/18 # I found that the hamburger buns at the 盒马鲜生 supermarket tasted particularly good, better than those I bought elsewhere, including affordable supermarkets in Hong Kong.\n9/21 # Guess who is so happy about buying a delivery service for two McFlurries and three fries at night.\n9/25 Love in Education # I want to cultivate professional, passionate students who know what love is and can love others. Love is crucial and has been neglected in education. We should love students equally, and teach them using professional knowledge, rather than persuade /pəˈsweɪd/ them using the unfair status and fake reasons (you know, students may be not as professional as you in your expert domain, but they are not stupid). We should love them equally. Of course, I don\u0026rsquo;t mean respect is unnecessary. Adults keep talking with ridicule that our generation \u0026ldquo;grew up in a sealed jar\u0026rdquo;. I think it\u0026rsquo;s not a flaw, it\u0026rsquo;s an advantage: only those who have been loved know how to love others and treat others kindly.\n9/30 The Third Dream # A dream: I was born in a big family. I wanted to swat a mosquito but I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find it. An adult dragged the arm of a sleeping baby, and the mosquito landed on the baby\u0026rsquo;s white, soft, vulnerable arm, so the adult swatted it easily. How impressive.\nI watched Chainsaw Man - The Movie: Reze Arc in Hong Kong on Monday before the week of the national day.\nThe movie poster I am tring a “specific citaiton” method. That means, I will try to mention the specific page(s) when quote others’ opinions/statements. Instead, when mentioning some general conclusions from studies, I will keep the general APA citation format. I think many reserchers (especially students) do not dinstinguish “quoting” and “citing” since these two distinct concepts share the same word in Chinese (i.e., 引用）. Maybe I should emphasise that in my future class (if I have) and encourage using this precise citation method.\nMy girlfriend watched me pee right at my flat before we left for dinner. She said that’s just an accident and she was just too curious about it, but that’s unfair. The next time when I noticed her peeing I rushed into the bathroom to pay back, but then I immediately realised that I cannot inspect her “faucet outlet” when she sat on the toilet since female has a quite different body structure to male. I also found that she used three pieces of tissues after peeing, but I usually only use one and fold it twice.\n","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/0001/","section":"Posts","summary":"Life Archive September 2025","title":"Life Archive September 2025","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/livehouse/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Livehouse","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/movie/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Movie","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/photograph/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Photograph","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/post/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Post","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/profile/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Profile","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/thoguhts/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Thoguhts","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/thoughts/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Thoughts","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"23 September 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"ZIQIAN WEI","summary":"","title":"ZIQIAN WEI","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"19 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/ai/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"AI","type":"tags"},{"content":" This isn\u0026rsquo;t my website, it\u0026rsquo;s Inter-Knot. It inspired my design. Take-home message: I described my recent experiences, my plans for posts, and how I built this homepage with the help of AI.\n1. A cosy moment for writing # It\u0026rsquo;s 10 o\u0026rsquo;clock, 19 August 2025, and I just finished my breakfast and took out the trash. It\u0026rsquo;s pouring /pɔː/ and thundering outside, but just Amber Rain (as shown on the Hong Kong Observatory website), not Black Rain, so people still need to go to work as usual, but not me, because I have applied for a vacation leave for the whole week. Can you imagine how cosy it is to write in my homely flat when it is raining outside in the morning?☕️\n2. On the brink of the new semester # In short, my contract as a research assistant will end on 31 August, and I will start my PhD study right after that, and the programme briefing and orientation session are on 3 September. The problem is that I am currently living in Shenzhen and need to commute to Hong Kong on weekdays by using my Hong Kong entry card, so I need to extend the entry card in order to continue to use it for my future study. I applied for a new card at the Shenzhen Luohu Entry/Exit Service Centre last Saturday. They cut my previous card and informed me that the new one will be sent to me within five working days. So, I cannot commute to Hong Kong without an entry card, which is why I am staying at home.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s good, because I can take a rest before the new semester. I can play video games, read manga books, practice the piano, etc. I can work for a while if I want when I have inspiration /ˌɪn.spɪˈreɪ.ʃən/. I can also manage my homepage, like adding a new post, which is what I am doing.\n3. Posting in English and Chinese # I write in English because I want to further improve my English to an advanced level. I think my current abilities are not terrible /ˈter.ə.bəl/, especially after so much time and effort I have spent, but I guess I just enjoy learning, which is also one of the reasons why I chose an academic career. I also enjoy reading and writing, not just academic writing (which is a job that can be routine sometimes), but also creative writing (such as online posts). You can see I have underlined some words/phrases; this is how I mark the expressions I am learning from AI during the writing of these posts. After writing, I can also use AI to proofread my work to avoid grammatical errors. I believe this is an effective way to gradually improve my language skills.\nBut still, I will post in Chinese, as I have built two language versions for my homepage. Maybe I will translate some of my original English posts into Chinese using AI first and then proofread them to avoid mistakes, if I have time. Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful these days, and I can use them to facilitate some processes. However, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I will translate some Chinese posts to English since some of my thoughts can be very trivial and culturally specific.\n4. Digital age self-expression # So, why a homepage? My friend Jiaao, who is studying for a PhD at Northeastern University, showed his academic homepage to me and recommended I do this too when I travelled to Hangzhou and Shaoxing this June. I like exploring new things, and I will definitely need a website to show myself in the future, especially when seeking a job after my PhD. The eventual goal is to use it as a lab website when I become a PI (hope this will happen one day🙏).\nI also found that people in distinct areas prefer different website building tools. My girlfriend, Bblythe, a designer who graduated from the University of Washington (Why has everyone studied in the USA except for me😫), builds and deploys her homepage using Webflow (https://webflow.com) or Figma (https://www.figma.com/sites/). I don\u0026rsquo;t remember which of them, but both are popular tools for designers and require no coding. Instead, Jiaao and I use GitHub (https://github.com), which is typically a git nerd\u0026rsquo;s choice🤓️.\n5. Hugo \u0026amp; Blowfish: easy-to-use framework # There are many uses of GitHub, which serves as a platform to deploy your homepage. You can search for some templates and change the content to yours, and follow the tutorials to deploy it. Yes, it looks technological, but it is easy.\nI decided to build my homepage via Hugo (https://gohugo.io), the world’s fastest framework for building websites, as asserted on its website. Hugo supports a multilingual homepage, thereby allowing me to edit English and Chinese content. It also supports both light and dark appearance. I browsed some templates and became obsessed with Blowfish (https://blowfish.page), a powerful, lightweight theme for Hugo.\nLet me tell you how easy it is. First, I downloaded template files from the Blowfish website and unzipped and renamed the folder as ziqian_website. Then, I opened some files (i.e., configuration, parameters, menu, post, etc.) to change the content to mine. To inspect the changes simultaneously, I opened the terminal on my laptop and input the following syntax to go to this folder.\ncd ziqian_website And then I typed:\nhugo server It provided a temporary link (e.g., http://localhost:1313/) for me to check how the website looks. This link can update immediately every time I make changes to the files. Some configuration files are HTML, and content files (i.e., posts) are written in Markdown (https://www.markdownguide.org). I have used Markdown to post some blogs on Chinese platforms, such as Jianshu (http://jianshu.com) and Zhihu (https://www.zhihu.com), so I am already familiar with it. Markdown is simple, and you can learn it in two minutes.\nSo, I completed the content for my homepage using the Blowfish template. The next step is to build it. Following the tutorial, we usually build the static website in a subfolder called public, so just go to this subfolder first.\ncd public Then, use this very concise syntax to build it.\nhugo After that, I created a new repository on my GitHub called ziqianworld.github.io, which would also be the link to the homepage (i.e., www.ziqianworld.github.io). I uploaded the files to this repository via the terminal and set up some GitHub Pages things. Boom! It automatically built and deployed my homepage. It was done!\nNote. There are two ways to remotely upload files to GitHub currently: HTTP and SSH keys. I found that AI defaults to using the HTTP way, but this doesn\u0026rsquo;t work right now and is not recommended by GitHub. So, you need to specifically prompt AI to use the SSH method. 6. Waterfall: My painful AI lesson # What is a waterfall layout? Well, it is the layout used by Xiaohongshu (https://www.xiaohongshu.com/explore), a popular social media platform in China, similar to Instagram. The difference is that Ins has a fixed grid layout, while Xiaohongshu (aka RedBook) utilises a more eye-catching waterfall layout (the professional term is the Masonry layout). I also got this inspiration from Inter-Knot, which is a function in the video game I am playing called Zenless Zone Zero (ZZZ), made by HoYoverse, the company that created Genshin: Impact. If you also play it, you can add me as a friend. My UID is shown in the screenshot.\nInter-Knot. it\u0026rsquo;s so coooooool! Let me show you the differences between them on social media. Here, the figure on the left is Ano\u0026rsquo;s Instagram profile (note: Ano is a Japanese pop singer), and the figure in the middle is Adrien Brody\u0026rsquo;s Xiaohongshu profile. You can directly inspect what grid and waterfall layouts are. The figure on the right shows a shortcut to the Apple Store app, which is discussed later in this post.\nIn my opinion, the magic of the waterfall layout is that you can always glimpse subsequent posts at the bottom, which attracts you to browse more. I like it, so after successfully deploying the initial version of my homepage, I wanted to change the default tedious layout to the waterfall layout. I prompted DeepSeek (https://chat.deepseek.com) to do so, which is a popular AI chatbot made by a Chinese company. When it was done, posts were ordered vertically from left to right, which was not what I wanted. I wish the posts could be organised in rows (i.e., the latest ones are on the first row), just like Xiaohongshu.\nA previous version of my homepage using a waterfall layout I prompted DeepSeek to alter the order again and again, wasting the whole day😫, until I searched online and realised that the current version of CSS does not support the real Masonry layout like Xiaohongshu, even though people have requsted this update in recent years. For example, I found a news article saying that the community is asking coding professionals to recommend and discuss the final Masonry syntax used in future versions of CSS. It is almost ready, but not available for now.\nNote. HTML (the website structure), CSS (visual design), and JavaScript (animation and interaction) are the three most important fundamental tools for website development. So, I was asking AI for an impossible mission (not that AI is Tom Cruise)! I didn\u0026rsquo;t realise it because I was just a website coding newbie! Here I learned an important lesson: you cannot just use AI to do everything you want if you are not an expert in the domain. You need to be an expert first, then utilise AI to enlarge your abilities and facilitate the creation.\n7. Cursor: An amazing AI code editor # I then decided to return to the conventional grid layout because I found that it looks smart on a small screen (e.g., smartphone) if you design well, just as you can see in the Apple Store figure above. At that moment, I had to learn a lot of stuff about HTML, CSS and JS if I wanted to redesign the layout. Fortunately, Bblythe told me that there is a state-of-the-art, powerful, influential AI code editor called Cursor (https://cursor.com). It fundamentally redefines how people code—no joke!\nBefore I used Cursor, I modified my homepage design like this.\nAsk AI how to change somthing on the browser Copy AI\u0026rsquo;s code, back to VS Code and paste Open other files to edit when needed Test the website and iterate steps 1-3 Note. VS Code is a Microsoft code editing platform I used to edit my website at the beginning, but it is out of date. I have now completely switched to Cursor and believe many others have too. In Cursor, you do things like this.\nCreate a new agent Ask it to do something Supervise how it browses and changes files, click Enter when needed Test the website and iterate steps 1-3 Note. You don\u0026rsquo;t open a new chat, instead, you hire a new agent in Cursor. An agent combines multiple AI models and uses large models to process complex tasks and/or reason about difficult problems, and uses small models to handle simple issues for efficiency. When working with Cursor, I felt like I was a boss, watching my employees working and giving approvals for their decisions. I don\u0026rsquo;t need to work by myself. How amazing! Someone may ask, if AI can do so many things for us, why are we still working? I think, at least, for me, I can do many interesting things with AI. That is enough. I have explored things and have fun. This is the purpose of life.\nCursor. Left: file explorer; Middle: file; Right: Agent. I also learned some lessons when using Cursor. First, when I asked Cursor to upload the completed static website files (i.e., the files under the public folder) to GitHub, it did so but also deleted all the source files! I believe the logic here is that once you install an app, the system usually prompts you to delete the installation package to free up storage space. I didn\u0026rsquo;t notice it because I was mindlessly pressing the Enter button at the time😅. Importantly, you cannot recover files deleted by Cursor. I had saved copies, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t a problem. However, I never used Cursor to upload the website afterwards, instead, I always did it manually.\nSecond, I decided to archive posts by year. I already have several temporal testing posts in 2025, and I created one more testing post in 2026. I believe this function has been embedded in Blowfish, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t inspect the success of archiving in 2026. I asked Cursor to check the issue again and again (just like when I asked DeepSeek to make a waterfall layout!), eventually, Cursor went into a self-repetition. I then realised that you cannot archive a post in the future of 2026 because it is now just 2025😅. Another good example of how people use AI inappropriately.\nAlso, if you want to make some minor changes (e.g., slightly enlarge the font size) but don\u0026rsquo;t know the corresponding syntax, you can ask Cursor to guide you to that place. I think if you are really doing something with the help of AI, instead of asking it to do it for you, you will finally become an expert because you are actually learning by doing something.\nIf you like my post, please share my homepage with others!\n# Page views: — Page visitors: — Site views: — Site visitors: — Statistics provided by Busuanzi (https://busuanzi.9420.ltd) ","date":"19 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/0000/","section":"Posts","summary":"I described my recent experiences, my plans for posts, and how I built this homepage with the help of AI.","title":"Building an Academic Homepage using AI","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"19 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/coding/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Coding","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"19 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/homepage/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Homepage","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/zh-cn/tags/academic/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Academic","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/cv/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cv","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/publication/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Publication","type":"tags"},{"content":"* Contributed equally; #: Corresponding author.\nLiteracy Development \u0026amp; Difficulties # Wei, Z., Wang, L., Xu, Z., Luo, L., Zhang, X., Li, N., \u0026amp; Liu, D#.

I am a PhD student at the Education University of Hong Kong (2025 - present), supervised by Dr. Phil Duo Liu. \n\nBefore that, I have worked as a full-time research assistent for three years in Beijing and Hongkong (2022-2025). I recevied my Master's degree (Psychological Foundation) from South China Normal University in 2022 and Bachelor's degree (Psychology) from Jiangxi Normal University in 2019. \n\nCurrently, my research interests consist of two areas:\n\n1. **Literacy development and difficulties in Chinese children and adolescents**, such as (a) protective and risk cognitive, motivational, and environmental factors of word reading (character reading and reading fluency), (b) individual differences between children with reading difficulties and typically developed children, and (c) academic performance in children with symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, literacy and math learning disabilities). Basically, I include diverse variables acorss domains and utilize advanced statistical models (e.g., machine learning and network analysis) to try to capture the pattern more comprehensively to support children's literacy development and educational needs.\n\n2. **The cognitive mechanism of reading comprehension**. When children enter higher grades, reading comprehension become more important and can still be critical for early adults's learning and academic achievement (e.g., college students). I estimate students' mental representation during comprehending complex texts via algorithms like Knowldge Structure, to understand the reading process and thereby inspire the design of interventions and strategies. \n\nOutside academic work, I am an amateur comic/manga creater (and hope I can publish my works someday in the future). I enjoy playing the piano and eletric guitar (but mainly the piano these days because I don't have much time). I also enjoy playing video games (Genshin Impact, ZZZ, and other interesting games on PS5). I live in Shenzhen with my adorable cats, Bblythe and シャンプー. --\u003e \n\n\u003ch2 class=\"relative group\"\u003eEducation and Work Experience \n    \u003cdiv id=\"education-and-work-experience\" class=\"anchor\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n    \n    \u003cspan\n        class=\"absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 ltr:-left-6 rtl:-right-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100 select-none\"\u003e\n        \u003ca class=\"group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700 !no-underline\" href=\"#education-and-work-experience\" aria-label=\"Anchor\"\u003e#\u003c/a\u003e\n    \u003c/span\u003e        \n    \n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Education University of Hong Kong\u003c/strong\u003e, PhD student (2025-expected 2028)\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Curriculum Vitae","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"3 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/cv/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Cv","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"3 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/publication/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Publication","type":"categories"}]
